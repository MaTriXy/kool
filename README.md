functional java collections

* `org.davidmoten.kool.LinkedList` offers
** lower memory usage than `java.util.LinkedList` (which is bidirectional and holds size as well)
** succinct functional methods (without having to use `.stream()`)
** convenient factory methods
** integration with a more flexible version of `Optional`.
